# Spotify API Library

This repository contains a custom Python library for interacting with the Spotify Web API, designed for a larger project focused on building a Spotify-powered website. The library currently implements various functions for managing albums, artists, songs, recommendations, playlists, and user profiles.

## Features

The library includes methods to handle specific Spotify API functions:
- **Authentication**: `get_token()` for authenticating with Spotify's API using client credentials.
- **Albums**: Search, retrieve album details, and manage library functions.
- **Artists**: Search for artists, get related artists, and retrieve top tracks.
- **Songs**: Search for tracks, retrieve details, and manage playback.
- **Recommendations**: Get recommended songs based on artist, genre, and track seeds.
- **Playlists**: Create playlists, add/remove tracks, and manage user playlists.
- **User Profiles**: Access user profile details.
- **Playback Control**: Skip tracks, pause, resume, and control playback volume.

## Installation

To use this library, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spotify-api-library.git
cd spotify-api-library
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Setup

1. **Obtain Spotify API Credentials**  
   - Register your app on the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications) to get a `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET`.
   
2. **Environment Variables**  
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your credentials:
     ```plaintext
     CLIENT_ID='your_client_id'
     CLIENT_SECRET='your_client_secret'
     ```

3. **Run the Authentication**  
   - Call the `get_token()` function to generate an access token for authenticated requests.
   
## Usage

The library functions are modular, each serving a specific use case. Hereâ€™s how to use some key features:

### Album Functions

- **Retrieve Album ID**
  ```python
  token = get_token()
  album_id = get_album_id(token, "Album Name")
  ```

- **Search for an Album**
  ```python
  album_details = search_for_album(token, "Album Name")
  print(album_details)
  ```

### Artist Functions

- **Search for an Artist**
  ```python
  artist_details = search_for_artist(token, "Artist Name")
  print(artist_details)
  ```

- **Get Top Tracks by Artist**

  ```

### Song Functions

- **Search for a Song**
  ```python
  song_details = search_for_song(token, "Song Name")
  ```

### Recommendations

- **Get Recommended Songs**
  ```python
  recommended_tracks = recommended_songs(token, "artist_id", "pop, rock", "track_id")
  ```

### Playlist Functions

- **Create a Playlist**
